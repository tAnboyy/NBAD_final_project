    <h2>Technical Aspects of the Project</h2>
    <p>This application is built as a Single Page Application (SPA) using Angular for the frontend and Java Spring Boot for the backend. The frontend communicates with the backend through HTTP calls, with JWT authentication ensuring secure access. Data is stored in a MySQL database, and charts are dynamically generated using D3.js library. The application is hosted on a single server, with NGINX serving the frontend on port 80 and proxying API requests to the backend on port 3000. Accessibility features follow WCAG guidelines, including ARIA labels, semantic HTML, and keyboard navigation.</p>
