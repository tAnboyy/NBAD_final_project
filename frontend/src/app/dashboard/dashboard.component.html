      <h2 id="tech-stack-title">Technical Aspects of the Project</h2>
      <p>This application is built as a Single Page Application (SPA) using Angular for the frontend and Java Spring Boot for the backend. The frontend communicates with the backend through HTTP calls, with JWT authentication ensuring secure access. Data is stored in a MySQL database, and charts are dynamically generated using D3.js.</p>
      <ul>
        <li><strong>Infra:</strong> NGINX serves the Angular build and proxies secure API calls to Spring Boot.</li>
        <li><strong>Security:</strong> HTTPS everywhere, JWT auth, BCrypt hashed passwords.</li>
        <li><strong>Data:</strong> Public APIs + MySQL innovations table feed the D3 visualizations.</li>
        <li><strong>Accessibility:</strong> Semantic markup, ARIA labels, keyboard-friendly controls.</li>
